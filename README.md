Known Issue

After creating a new cookie, the application redirects to a page displaying the raw data of the cookie in MongoDB, resulting in a blank screen with JSON data. Users need to manually navigate back to the home page and then proceed to the shop section to see the newly added cookie.


The application is successfully connected to MongoDB and functions correctly.
